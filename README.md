# Eigen Portfolios
After finishing MIT 18.06 on Linear Algebra, I wanted to put my new found knowledge to good use. I knew about the traditional approach of Markovitz mean-variance optimization, but I was curious to explore other approaches. This led me to attempt Eigen decomposition on the basket of stocks contained within popular indices like DJI to create an optimized portfolio.
